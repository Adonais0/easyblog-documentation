<Note>
  Before you can make requests to the Protocol API, you will need to grab your
  API key from your dashboard. You find it under [Settings &raquo; API](#).

```json {{ title: 'Example webhook payload' }}
{
  "id": "a056V7R7NmNRjl70",
  "type": "conversation.updated",
  "payload": {
    "id": "WAz8eIbvDR60rouK"
    // ...
  }
}
```

In the example above, a conversation was `updated`, and the payload type is a `conversation`.
